# sm-json-data
## Aim of the Project
This project intends to represent Super Metroid's layout and navigation in a format that is handy for software to read and interpret. The primary goal is to eventually be used by the SMZ3 combo randomizer (https://github.com/tewtal/alttp_sm_combo_randomizer) to build its logic, expanding that project's possibilities.

However, the intent is for the data model to also be usable for other projects related to Super Metroid.
